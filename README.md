# Cache Bank Business Landing Page Portfolio Piece

This project aims to demonstrate high-quality code that is easy to read and follow. The page is designed to be responsive and aesthetically pleasing, primarily using Tailwind CSS. This project also serves as a platform to showcase our presentation skills. We utilized HTML5, CSS3 with Tailwind, and JavaScript, with a significant emphasis on Tailwind CSS. The starter code was provided to us via GitHub.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

-We primarily used grid and flex to structure the page, which was easy to understand because we have experience from previous projects. -Tailwind requires basic understanding in HTML and CSS. The projects we have already completed provided the basics in HTML and CSS which made Tailwind better to understand. 
-Tailwind simplifies media queries by using built in responsive classes. 

### Challenges Faced

-The confusing part about doing this project is the number of div tags that was used.
-Not placing elements in the correct div can mess up sections of your project.
-Not closing some tags can also make the styling of the elements to be void.
-Spelling errors are also a big contributor to some of the elements not being styled as they should be.

### Areas for Improvement

-Paying more closely to opening and closing tags which can have a huge impact on the page layout and styling.
-Checking for spelling mistakes can also be improved.

### Overall Learning Experience

In this project we learned a lot about Tailwind and how powerful it is in designing web pages. It also taught us how we can easily apply responsive styles directly in the HTML markup using the provided breakpoints and how utilize these responsive classes which can enable the creation of responsive and mobile-friendly designs.
